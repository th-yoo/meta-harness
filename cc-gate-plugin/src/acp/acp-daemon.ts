// acp-daemon.ts — §6e ACP daemon: a SessionPool (acp-pool.ts) of WarmSessions
// behind the ACP wire subset, implementing the §6e wire-send boundary law.
//
// N3c-iii (2026-08-04): rewired off a single `WarmSession` onto the pool.
// The daemon still mints one ACP session id per REQUEST (session/new is
// cheap: a UUID plus recording the caller's isolation), but the keep-alive
// underneath is now a pool of WarmSessions keyed by isolation VALUE — a
// caller-chosen isolation crosses the wire on session/new instead of the
// daemon defaulting every session to the one hardcoded gauge isolation.
//
// THE ENV CONTRACT (round-4 I2): this process fingerprints and binds from
// its OWN process.env — envFingerprint(process.env) is what `initialize`
// echoes and socketPath(process.env) is what it listens on. Whoever spawns
// it MUST pass, explicitly, the same env object it fingerprinted. The repo's
// established detached-spawn idiom (hook-cli.ts:147-154) passes no `env` and
// inherits, which is correct only when the spawner fingerprinted
// process.env itself. acp-client.ts's ensureDaemon (a later node) passes it
// explicitly.
//
// session/new is cheap (UUID mint + a well-formedness check on the caller's
// isolation) and its `cwd` is accepted-and-IGNORED (the instrument pins a
// neutral cwd, §6e delta (b)); the /clear recycle happens when a prompt
// lands on a pool entry whose last DISPATCH-time occupant was a DIFFERENT
// session — so a multi-prompt ACP session keeps its context while the
// deriver (fresh session per record) always gets a clean one, exactly as
// before, just tracked per pool entry (`lastServedBySessionForEntry`) now
// that more than one warm entry can exist. Committed at DISPATCH time, not
// serve time, or interleaved sessions leak context into each other — same
// reasoning as the pre-pool `lastServedSessionId`, just re-scoped.
//
// Cancel tags are DAEMON-MINTED UUIDs, never the client's JSON-RPC id: two
// clients both start their id counters at 1, and a colliding tag would let
// one caller's cancel interrupt another caller's already-billed turn.
//
// Failure is a JSON-RPC ERROR carrying data.callConsumed (law L3 step (i)'s
// authoritative channel), never a fake stopReason, and the outcome is passed
// straight through from TurnOutcome.kind — the daemon adds no classification
// of its own.
//
// The MODEL fields are forwarded VERBATIM from TurnOutcome (the modelUsage
// KEY and its canonicalModel) and are NEVER compared here: the real API keys
// usage by the dated snapshot id while callers request the undated alias
// (round-4 C1), and reconciliation via modelProvenBy belongs at the caller,
// which is the only party that knows what it asked for.
//
// `_meta` is namespaced under `kkamak` throughout (T2n) — the ACP
// extensibility rule reserves bare `_meta` root keys for the protocol
// itself; acp-wire.ts's Acp* types are the authority, this file just
// produces/consumes literals shaped like them.
//
// EVERY runtime side effect below is behind `import.meta.main`. acp-client
// imports NOTHING from this file (see acp-paths.ts's own header for why the
// path helpers live in a separate module the hook can safely import).

// N3c-iii: the direct `new WarmSession(env, warmBudgetOpts(env))` + its
// env-overridable `turnTimeoutMs` leg are GONE from this file — SessionPool
// (acp-pool.ts) now owns budget construction for every WarmSession it spawns,
// including honoring `KKAMAK_ACP_TURN_TIMEOUT_MS` itself (mirrored
// byte-for-byte off this file's old `warmBudgetOpts`, acp-pool.ts's
// `parseTurnTimeoutMs`), so a `new SessionPool(env)` here is a complete
// replacement, not an approximation.

/** DEVIATION FROM THE PLAN TEXT, MEASURED (documented in the N3a report):
 * the brief's sequence is "listen → on EADDRINUSE, probe". Measured on this
 * runtime (Bun 1.3.1, node:net): `server.listen(path)` does NOT raise
 * EADDRINUSE when another live process already owns that Unix socket path
 * — it silently rebinds and steals the path out from under the first
 * listener (isolated repro: two `net.createServer().listen(sameSock)`
 * calls both report "listening", and new connections go to the SECOND —
 * the first is silently orphaned, never receiving another connection
 * again). Relying on EADDRINUSE here is therefore not a race-safety
 * problem, it is DEAD CODE: the signal this file's takeover logic is
 * supposed to react to never fires on this runtime, so a starter would
 * always "successfully" steal a live daemon's path.
 *
 * Fix: probe FIRST, always, before ever calling `listen`, and keep the
 * whole probe→(unlink)→listen sequence inside the caller's bind-lock
 * critical section exactly as the plan requires — the lock (a `wx`-created
 * file, unrelated to net.Server and unaffected by this quirk) is what
 * actually serializes two starters; the EADDRINUSE branch was only ever an
 * optimization to skip the probe on the uncontended path, and skipping it
 * is unconditionally safe, just marginally slower. An EADDRINUSE handler
 * is kept as a defensive fallback in case this Bun behavior changes. */

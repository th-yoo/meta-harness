// send-prompt.ts — N1 of docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-04-send-prompt-interface.md.
//
// The interface every one-shot LLM caller in this repo actually wants: one
// call, model per call, text out — the shape the OpenAI SDK exposes. A
// previous design modelled these callers (gauge classifier, proposer,
// reviewer, judge) as ACP *sessions*; the user ruled that a session here
// "is just keep-alive", so no caller sees one. Keep-alive, connection
// pooling and warm subprocesses are provider-internal from here down.
//
// THIS MODULE SHIPS NO PROVIDER. `anthropic-api` / `anthropic-cli-warm` /
// `openai` are N2/N3/N4. It must not import any provider module, the
// package's warm-session or acp-client internals, or `@anthropic-ai/sdk`,
// and must not spawn anything — its tests register FAKE providers. That
// isolation is the point: N2 proves this interface against a transport that
// already works, so when N3's warm path misbehaves the interface is not
// also on trial.
//
// The `WarmIsolation` import below pulls from `@th-yoo/cc-api-daemon`, the
// external package's barrel. That import MUST stay `import type` — `import
// type` is fully erased, so no value from the barrel enters this module's
// runtime graph. This matters MORE now than it did against the local acp
// dir's barrel it replaces (formerly `src/acp/index.ts`, now retired in
// favor of the package): this package's `index.ts` value-exports
// `ApiSession` and `listModels`, and THEIR import chain
// (`index.ts` -> `api-session.ts` -> `call.ts` -> `client.ts`) does a
// TOP-LEVEL `import Anthropic from "@anthropic-ai/sdk"`. A value import from
// this barrel — even one that only ever touches `WarmIsolation` at the type
// level in source — would pull the Anthropic SDK into the module graph
// eagerly. If this is ever widened to a value import, that isolation is
// broken even though this comment would otherwise look satisfied — so treat
// the `type` keyword below as load-bearing, not cosmetic.
//
// `sendPrompt` NEVER throws. Every failure — including a provider that
// itself throws — comes back as a `SendOutcome`. A caller that prefers
// exceptions wraps this.

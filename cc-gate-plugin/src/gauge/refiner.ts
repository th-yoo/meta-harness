// km-gauge refiner (pre-reg §2.2, v2 design 2026-07-29) — pure pieces of the
// derivation step: prompt construction + output parsing. The actual claude
// spawn lives in refiner-cli.ts (detached child); nothing here touches IO.
//
// v2 EXTRACTS ONLY: the refiner classifies the prompt (A1/A2/B/C/D) and, for
// class C only, extracts a check verbatim-anchored to the prompt. It never
// invents a check. Enforcement of the extraction discipline (check-iff-C,
// path-in-prompt, in-repo-scope, …) happens in code — validate.ts — never
// here; parseRefinerOutput below is SHAPE validation only.

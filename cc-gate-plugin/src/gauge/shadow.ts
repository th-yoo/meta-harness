/**
 * Pure two-strike policy (pre-reg §2.3 / v2 extractor design, review

 * single-turn C, every other class (A1/A2/B/D), and a v1-legacy pending (no
 * `class` at all) are TODAY'S BEHAVIOR: `field` passes through unchanged and
 * the pending is always consumed (`keepPending: false`).
 *
 * Strike advancement REQUIRES a real floor cycle (`floorRan`) [review M6].
 * In production, shadowEvaluateAtStop never calls this (or evaluateGauge)
 * for an open multi-turn-C pending when `floorRan` is false — it skips
 * straight to a passthrough-only field (see M6' below). The `floorRan`
 * branch here exists so that rule is directly unit-testable in isolation.

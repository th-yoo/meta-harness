// §6e ACP wire subset. Hand-rolled, dependency-free (user ruling: "ACP is
// just interface not implementation"): JSON-RPC 2.0, newline-delimited,
// the methods this daemon serves. Wire shapes transcribed from
// agentclientprotocol.com (protocol/session-setup, protocol/prompt-turn);
// fixtures in acp-wire.test.ts are the conformance record.
//
// SCOPE: a PRIVATE INSTRUMENT PROFILE of the ACP wire, not a
// general-purpose ACP agent — `_meta.kkamak.model` is REQUIRED on
// session/prompt, `session/new.cwd` is accepted-and-ignored (the instrument
// pins a neutral cwd), and `session/cancel` is answerable as a request.
// Off-the-shelf editor clients are explicitly out of scope.
//
// Transport-agnostic: the daemon binds it to a Unix socket, and a --stdio
// flag binds the same dispatcher to stdin/stdout for our own tooling.
//
// Imports nothing but node:string_decoder, deliberately: transport.ts
// imports this module eagerly and transport.ts is on hook-cli.ts's eager
// import path (hook-cli.ts:24).

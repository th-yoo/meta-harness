// §6e WarmSession: one streaming-input Query, ONE persistent message pump
// BOUND TO ITS QUERY GENERATION, a lossless pushable input queue, /clear
// recycling SEQUENCED on the SDK's own conversation_reset message, FIFO
// turns, every wait capped, close() observed at every suspension point,
// and three-way outcomes that implement §6e's wire-send boundary law
// mechanically.
//
// Isolation options are the §6d set (agent-transport.ts:119-132) with TWO
// registered deltas (§6e):
//  (a) REMOVED `maxTurns: 1` + `abortController` — query-scoped, cannot
//      transfer to a many-turn session (maxTurns, sdk.d.ts:1674-1678, would
//      stop the whole Query after record #1; aborting the shared controller
//      would kill every later turn). Replaced by per-turn call accounting +
//      interrupt().
//  (b) ADDED a neutral `cwd` — §6d measured it payload-neutral (spec line
//      690) and agent-transport.ts:41-44 omits it as redundant for a
//      one-shot; for a host-global daemon it is what stops the instrument
//      varying with whichever session spawned it.
//
// Lazy SDK VALUE import (hook processes must not pay the ~84 ms package
// load; same finding as agent-transport.ts:102-108). The `import type`
// below is erased and costs nothing.

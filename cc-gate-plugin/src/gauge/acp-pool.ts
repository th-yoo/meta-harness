// §6e ACP warm lane — SessionPool: a pool of long-lived WarmSessions keyed
// by isolation VALUE, not by profile id or session id.
//
// Reshaped by the 2026-08-04 send-prompt-interface ruling
// (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-04-send-prompt-interface.md): callers
// never see sessions, so the S1 profile registry the session-pool plan's S2
// assumed is CANCELLED. The daemon mints an ACP session id per REQUEST; the
// keep-alive underneath is this pool of WarmSessions. One WarmSession = one
// CLI subprocess + one transcript (~330 MB RSS measured, see the cap
// default below). CONCURRENT requests must get separate WarmSessions;
// SEQUENTIAL requests REUSE a warm one via /clear recycle — hence
// acquire/release, not the plan's open-by-profile/get/close-by-session-id.
//
// node-n3c-ii-brief.md governs over the plan's S2 text where they differ.

 * daemon-side `makeSession` override was considered and rejected: it would
 * split budget construction into two authorities (pool default vs. daemon
 * factory), the exact divergence class the explicit-budgets rule (every leg
 * named here, never left to a caller's own defaulting) exists to prevent.
 *
 * Mirrors acp-daemon.ts's (now-removed) `warmBudgetOpts` EXACTLY,
 * byte-for-byte in behavior, not `parseMaxSessions`'s stricter
 * finite-then-clamp rule: `Number(raw) || ACP_BUDGET.turnTimeoutMs`. Unset,
 * `"0"`, and non-numeric garbage all coerce to a falsy `Number(...)` and
 * fall through the `||` to the raw constant; any other numeric string is
 * honored VERBATIM, deliberately unclamped and unvalidated here — that is
 * `warmBudgetOpts`'s own existing behavior (it never floors to
 * `CLI_SPAWN_BUDGET_MS` either), and WarmSession's own constructor already
 * owns that floor (warm-session.ts's `Math.max(CLI_SPAWN_BUDGET_MS, ...)`),

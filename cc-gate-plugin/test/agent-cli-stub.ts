// Wire-capture finding (2026-08-03): the CLI process the Agent SDK spawns
// ALWAYS sends `stream: true` on /v1/messages — this is not toggled by any
// `Options` field (checked sdk.d.ts; no such option exists). A stub that
// answers with `Response.json(...)` (a plain, non-streaming body — the shape
// `sdkCall`'s stub in this same file's earlier tests correctly uses for the
// non-agent-sdk transport, since @anthropic-ai/sdk's `messages.create`
// defaults to non-streaming) fails Bun's `fetch()`-based SSE parsing inside
// the spawned CLI, which then silently FALLS BACK to a second, non-streaming
// request. That fallback is what first measured 2+ calls here — it is a test
// double defect, not a real extra model call: against the real Anthropic API
// (which always answers a `stream:true` request with a valid SSE body) the
// fallback path is never exercised. The fix is an SSE-shaped response, not a
// loosened assertion. Confirmed by wire capture: the CLI also separately
// issues a `HEAD /api/hello` connectivity probe before the real call; the
// shared `stubServer` helper's `body: (await req.json())` throws on that
// bodiless HEAD (visible as a benign "HEAD - /api/hello failed" stderr line)
// but the throw happens before `captured.push`, so it never reaches our
// `handler` callback and does not inflate CAPTURED.
//
// Fix round 3 (2026-08-03): `agentSdkCall` no longer sends `outputFormat`,
// so the CLI no longer forces a `StructuredOutput` tool — the model just
// emits plain text (our schema requirement now rides in the prompt text
// instead, and `parseRefinerOutput`/`parseChannelOutput` tolerate it). The
// stub therefore answers with a plain TEXT SSE stream, not a `tool_use`
// block — replaces the old `sseStructuredOutput` helper.
//
// `model` (Task 4 Step 0 addition): optional trailing parameter, defaulting
// to the incumbent literal, so a test can make the stub declare a DATED
// snapshot id in `message_start` and drive the CLI to key `modelUsage` by
// it (round-4 C1). Every pre-existing call site is byte-unchanged by this
// addition.

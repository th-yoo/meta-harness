# RESUME — start here

**New session / new host: read this first.** (Personal memory is host-local and
does NOT transfer; this file + the repo are the source of truth.)

## Where we are (2026-07-15)

First propose→ab improvement loop (#5). Done: baseline (haiku pass@5 **0.381**),
14-task band split, store-writing run, **propose → account-global `v1`**
(a real generalized playbook). The `ab` verdict (v0 vs v1) is the last step.

Landed overnight 2026-07-15→16 (MacBook, pushed to `main`):
- **Prompt-mining plan EXECUTED** (was saved-only) — `docs/external-prompts-cc-opencode.md`
  (17-row verdict table, 22-bullet dual-tagged seed corpus, 6 meta-prompt lessons),
  the two HIGH lessons applied to `buildProposerPrompt` (L1 untrusted-evidence,
  L2 evidence-gated rejection list — conditional on non-empty failures so fresh-layer
  bootstrap still writes a baseline; live propose smoke passed), and
  `docs/target-model-axis.md` spec (additive-only v1; build deferred,
  `explicitly-not-now.md` §2.4). Raw extraction scratch: `.superpowers/sdd/mining/`
  (host-local, MacBook). Seed corpus is measure-first: do NOT hand-seed until
  loop-1's ab shows what propose finds on its own.
- **Phase-0 self-score correlation run DONE** (best-of-k gate; MacBook, 2026-07-16
  morning): 43 baseline tasks × k=1 haiku `--self-check` →
  `term-bench2/results/phase0-selfscore-haiku.json`. **GATE: UNDERSIZED, not
  predictive on current data** — pass@1 5/43 (11.6%); capture rate 11/43 (26%,
  haiku usually skips the self-check); among captured pairs essentially every
  self-claim is 1.0 (no variance), so score-value lift is only +2.7pp (30% vs
  27.3% within-pairs base) with 7/10 self-PASS claims false-positive; N=11 < 30
  floor. Per the plan's stopping rule: do NOT build the k-loop on this. Two real
  findings: (1) the self-report VALUE is near-uninformative as-is; (2) writing a
  self-check at ALL correlates with success (27.3% vs 6.3% for non-compliant
  runs) — compliance is the stronger signal. NEXT (deliberate revision):
  strengthen `SELF_CHECK_INSTRUCTION` (`opencode-plugin/src/bench/self-score.ts`)
  to force compliance + honest fractions, then re-run the 43-task night.

Landed 2026-07-15 (all pushed to `main`):
- **Store is git-syncable** — `term-bench2/store-sync.sh` + `term-bench2/store/` snapshot (next section). No more scp.
- **Verifier-timeout bug fixed** — `--max-verifier-timeout` now bounds each attempt (was unbounded; `ab` command below already includes it).
- **Tier-2 machinery HARDENED** (`7503ae0`) — adversarial review of the office-host code found + fixed 2 Critical + 4 Important bugs before any loop leans on it: squad-run pins one def-version per slice (no mid-run-activation drift); `squad-trial` is now a PAIRED comparison with the tier-1 McNemar significance test (no promote-on-noise, default n=5 floor); Phase-0 self-score gate floors on self-PASS sample size (n=1 greenlight killed); `flow.reentry` frozen; failure retrieval blends importance×diversity. 916 tests green. Detail: `.superpowers/sdd/tier2-fix-report.md` + `selfscore-fix-report.md`.
- **Slack/OpenClaw fixed** (fleet, oc-test side) — root cause of "#oc doesn't answer" was `requireMention` defaulting true (plain messages dropped as `no-mention`), NOT agent provisioning. Fix: `requireMention:false` on #oc. Token-free patch + sanitized gateway template in `oc-test/agents-fleet/gateway/` for office-host bring-up (new bot). Live DM outbound proven.

**BLOCKER / NEXT (precise):** `v1` currently lives ONLY in the **linux host's**
store — it is NOT yet in the git snapshot (`term-bench2/store/global/candidates/`
holds `v0` only, seeded from the MacBook). So the *one immediate action* is on the
**linux host**: `git pull && term-bench2/store-sync.sh export && git add term-bench2/store && git commit -m "store: loop-1 v1" && git push`.
After that, ANY host: `git pull && store-sync.sh import` → v1 is in the store → run `ab`.

Full detail + v1's diagnosis & playbook: **[loop-1-state.md](loop-1-state.md)**.

## The store travels via git now (no scp)

The account store (`~/.config/meta-harness` — candidates v0/v1, active, playbooks,
traces, role/squad stores) is mirrored into the repo at **`term-bench2/store/`** by
`term-bench2/store-sync.sh`. So loop artifacts cross hosts by `git push`/`git pull`.

- **Host that HAS the new candidate** (e.g. linux with v1):
  ```
  git pull
  term-bench2/store-sync.sh export          # ~/.config/meta-harness -> term-bench2/store/
  git add term-bench2/store && git commit -m "store: loop-N candidates" && git push
  ```
- **Other host** (e.g. MacBook, to run `ab`):
  ```
  git pull
  term-bench2/store-sync.sh import          # term-bench2/store/ -> ~/.config/meta-harness (backs up existing to .bak)
  ls ~/.config/meta-harness/global/candidates/   # expect: v0 v1
  ```
Discipline (single-user serial, like the old scp-replace): **pull+import before working, export+push after.** `import` is a full mirror (`--delete`) but backs up the prior store to `.bak` first; `store-sync.sh diff` shows drift.

## Resume the loop (Path A — keeps this exact v1)

1. `cd ~/z2/meta-harness && git pull && term-bench2/store-sync.sh import` (brings v1 into the store).
2. Bench prereqs (macOS): `podman machine start` (if needed) → `bun term-bench2/runner.ts prep --apply`. Needs the TB2 task repo at `~/z2/terminal-bench-2`.
3. Run `ab` (detached, ~3–5 hr, resumable). **Bound each attempt** with the timeout flags (verifier was uncapped — fixed 2026-07-15):
   ```
   nohup bun term-bench2/runner.ts ab --layer account-global --candidate v1 \
     --split-file term-bench2/splits/loop1.json --model anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5 \
     --k 2 --max-agent-timeout 600 --max-verifier-timeout 300 --resume \
     > term-bench2/logs/loop1-ab.log 2>&1 &
   ```
4. Verdict: `bun term-bench2/runner.ts report-loop`; on accept → `/mh-activate account v1`, then `store-sync.sh export` + commit + push so every host has the new active.

**No committed v1 yet?** Path B (re-derives a DIFFERENT v1): store-writing run
`run --task-file term-bench2/splits/loop1-band.txt --k 2 --layers account --model anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5`,
then start opencode + `/mh-propose account` (the `external_directory` grant is already in `opencode.json`), then `ab` as above.

## Gotchas (already handled, don't re-hit)
- Account-scope propose needs `opencode.json` → `"permission": {"external_directory": "allow"}` (committed) — else the headless proposer hangs on a permission prompt.
- `--results-file` forces `--no-store` (a run feeds the store OR writes results, never both); store-writing runs aren't resumable; `ab` is.
